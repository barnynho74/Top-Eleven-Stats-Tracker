How to Use the Top Eleven Stats Tracker

At first glance this tracker might look complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it‚Äôs actually really simple. Use this guide as a quick reference whenever you forget something.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Adding Players (Progress tab)
Go to the Progress tab and click the green "+" button to add players. Give them a name, choose their position(s), set their age, and enter their quality percentage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Minutes Tab ![Minutes] https://github.com/barnynho74/Top-Eleven-Stats-Tracker/blob/main/1%20minutes.png?raw=true
After EVERY COMPETITIVE MATCH (except FA matches), enter each player‚Äôs minutes on the Minutes tab. Don‚Äôt forget the substitutes!

üëâ PRO TIP: first select all the players who played the full 90 minutes and Confirm them. After that, handle the subs. 
My personal method:
-> Start with the player who got subbed out and type in the minutes he played
-> Then select the player who came in and simply subtract that number from 90. That way you won‚Äôt forget who played how long

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Goals & Assists Tab ![GandA] https://github.com/barnynho74/Top-Eleven-Stats-Tracker/blob/main/2%20goals%20assists.png?raw=true
After you type in minutes from step 1, move on to the Goals & Assists tab and enter goals and assists for each player.
BE CAREFULL to select the correct competition (League, Champions League, or Cup). Here you can see both total contributions across all competitions and per-90 stats for each player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Progress Updates & Training ![progress] https://github.com/barnynho74/Top-Eleven-Stats-Tracker/blob/main/4%20progress.png?raw=true
At the end of the day, once you‚Äôve played your LAST COMPETITVE MATCH (‚ö†Ô∏è FA matches do NOT count ‚Äì they don‚Äôt consume condition, players don‚Äôt improve, and goals/assists aren‚Äôt tracked), you should:
       1. First train your players and then
       2. Log their daily progress in the Progress tab (click on each player and update the right box for the day)

At the top of the tab you‚Äôll see your squad‚Äôs average quality and age, and you can also check daily averages across the team.
If you CHANGED a player‚Äôs name or added a new role, use the yellow EDIT button.
The green ARCHIVE button saves a player into your club history (perfect for legends or sentimental favorites).

4. Most Improved Tab ![improved] https://github.com/barnynho74/Top-Eleven-Stats-Tracker/blob/main/3%20most%20improved.png?raw=true
This tab summarizes everything: progress, stats, and a chart showing how players improve based on their age.

üëâ PRO TIP: The players who usually improve the most are in the 18‚Äì21 age range. Investing in them pays off long term.
üëâ PRO TIP 2: The Training Bonus Calculator is really handy. Enter number 6 into all the slots leading up to your next match.
               The calculator will then tell you what fatigue level your players need to be at so they regenerate to at least 94% (or whatever target you prefer) for the match.

üìå Example:
My players regenerate every 3 hours at xx:10 (like 02:10, 05:10, 08:10, ‚Ä¶).
If my next match is at 19:33, and it‚Äôs currently 09:27, that means I‚Äôll get regenerations at 11:10, 14:10, and 17:10 ‚Äî 3 regenerations in total.
So I can train my players down to 76‚Äì81% condition now, and by match time they‚Äôll all be back at 94%+. That way, they‚Äôre fully ready.

5. Archived Players Tab ![archivedpl] https://github.com/barnynho74/Top-Eleven-Stats-Tracker/blob/main/5%20archived%20players.png?raw=true
Pretty straightforward ‚Äî this tab lists all players you‚Äôve archived (sold, retired, or just saved for sake of it).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Power Ranking Tab ![powerrank] https://github.com/barnynho74/Top-Eleven-Stats-Tracker/blob/main/6%20power%20ranking.png?raw=true
This tab shows each player‚Äôs overall ‚Äúpower score.‚Äù It takes into account several factors (quality, improvement, goals/assists, usage, and age bonus), 
then combines them into a single score using a formula. Basically, it‚Äôs a way to quickly see who your most valuable and impactful players are.

Final Notes

That‚Äôs it! Just remember to keep logging every match so the data stays accurate. 
Missing a day isn‚Äôt the end of the world (everything still adds up correctly), but the more consistent you are, the better picture you‚Äôll get of your squad.

I built this tool as a personal assistant for tracking which players are truly developing well and which ones should be sold.
It helps me make smarter long-term decisions and keep my team competitive.
