Top Eleven Stats Tracker is a web-based tool designed for managers to keep track of their players’ progress, performance, and overall squad development throughout the season.

The tracker allows you to:

+ Add and manage players with details (name, age, positions and quality percentage)
+ Monitor player progress over a 28-day training cycle, with daily inputs and squad averages
+ Track minutes played per match, automatically updating totals and matches played
+ Log goals and assists across different competitions, with per-90 statistics
+ Identify most improved players, supported by sortable tables and a bubble chart visualization that compares age, minutes, and improvement
+ Generate Power rankings using a custom weighted formula that evaluates quality, improvement, goal involvement, usage, and age value
+ Archive players and seasons to preserve historical data while preparing for new campaigns
+ Backup and restore data via simple download and upload options
+ Training calculator, which helps balance training bonuses across multiple sessions during the day

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no backend or database required — all data is saved locally in the browser via LocalStorage. This makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to use on any modern device.
Whether you want to optimize training, compare players, or simply keep a history of your squad’s development, this tool provides a practical, manager-friendly interface that enhances the Top Eleven experience.
